* Version 0.1.0 on 2022-04-15

Initial release of the package.  Please read the manual.

The core idea for this package was implemented in the =prot-cursor.el=
file that is part of [[https://sr.ht/~protesilaos/dotfiles/][my dotfiles]] (now deprecated).  I was using it at
least since the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021.
