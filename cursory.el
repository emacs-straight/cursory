;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Cursory provides a thin wrapper around built-in variables that affect
;; the style of the Emacs cursor on graphical terminals.  The intent is to
;; allow the user to define preset configurations such as "block with slow
;; blinking" or "bar with fast blinking" and set them on demand.
;;
;; The user option `cursory-presets' holds the presets.  The command
;; `cursory-set-preset' is used to select one among them.  Selection
;; supports minibuffer completion when there are multiple presets, else
;; sets the single preset outright.
;;
;; Presets consist of a list of properties that govern the cursor type in
;; the active and inactive windows, as well as cursor blinking variables.
;; They look like this:
;;
;;     (bar
;;      :cursor-type (bar . 2)
;;      :cursor-in-non-selected-windows hollow
;;      :blink-cursor-blinks 10
;;      :blink-cursor-interval 0.5
;;      :blink-cursor-delay 0.2)
;;
;; The car of the list is an arbitrary, user-defined symbol that identifies
;; (and can describe) the set.  Each of the properties corresponds to
;; built-in variables: `cursor-type', `cursor-in-non-selected-windows',
;; `blink-cursor-blinks', `blink-cursor-interval', `blink-cursor-delay'.
;; The value each property accepts is the same as the variable it
;; references.
;;
;; When called from Lisp, the `cursory-set-preset' command requires a
;; PRESET argument, such as:
;;
;;     (cursory-set-preset 'bar)
;;
;; The default behaviour of `cursory-set-preset' is to change cursors
;; globally.  The user can, however, limit the effect to the current
;; buffer.  With interactive use, this is done by invoking the command with
;; a universal prefix argument (`C-u' by default).  When called from Lisp,
;; the LOCAL argument must be non-nil.
;;
;; The function `cursory-store-latest-preset' is used to save the last
;; selected style in the `cursory-latest-state-file'.  The value can then
;; be restored with the `cursory-restore-latest-preset' function.
